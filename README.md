# Fenrir

Fenrir, named after the wolf foretold to kill Odin, is a Cryptographic program
designed to test the efficiency and latency of Identity-Based Cryptography in 
constrained IOT. This program is to be tested against PKI solutions to find 
which is best.

## Current questions
1. How are the hash functions mapped to G1 and G2

## Helpful notes
- The Weil pairing on an elliptic curve is used for identity-based key establishment
and encryption methods (http://www.errthum.com/eric/Works/tatevweil.pdf)
- DO ETHICS FORMS
